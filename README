This project provides some convenience functions that can be
used with the stock Go language major Emacs mode (go-mode.el) 
provided by Google. 

The file provided is gme.el (stands for "Go Mode Extra"). Also
some supporting command line tools (written in Go Language) is 
provided for use by gme.el. To use,

1. First install the stock go-mode 
   (available in your $GOROOT/misc/emacs directory).

2. Then copy the gme.el file to the same directory
   where the stock go-mode.el and go-mode-load.el files are
   kept.

3. Add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file:
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(load "gme")
(add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'gme)
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Also go to the gme-go-tools folder, and compile the goimports.go
file as follows:
8g goimports.go
8l -o goimports goimports.8

Then copy the executable 'goimports' to a folder which is in your PATH.

That's it.

This is my first elisp program. So, although this works
on my setup, you might find it buggy. If so, please do
let me know. Also please let me know if you find it at
all useful, or if you have any suggestions.
