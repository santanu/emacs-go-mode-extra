This project provides some convenience functions that can be
used with the stock Go language major Emacs mode (go-mode.el) 
provided by Google. 

The file provided is go-mode-extra.el. To use it, 

1. First install the stock go-mode 
   (available in your $GOROOT/misc/emacs directory).

2. Then copy the go-mode-extra.el file to the same directory
   where the stock go-mode.el and go-mode-load.el files are
   kept.

3. Add the following lines to your ~/.emacs file:
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(load "go-mode-extra")
(add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'go-mode-extra)
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

This is my first elisp program. So, although this works
on my setup, you might find it buggy. If so, please do
let me know. Also please let me know if you find it at
all useful, or if you have any suggestions.
